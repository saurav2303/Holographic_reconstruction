# Holographic_reconstruction 
we have gone through various good paper ( reference mentioned in code itself) over holographic reconstruction and tried putting all that formulation and ideas into single python code.
I have doen all these work as part of THESIS titled "Miniaturised Microscopy" under the guidance of my Thesis Advisor Dr. Shishir Kumar , professor in Electrical Department of IIT Hyderabad.
And i am looking forward to add more.
