Getting started with microscope
 
1). Put the dongle(NIS-BR) to CPU.
2). Make sure that Nikon control unit, microscope and cpu are getting power supply
2). Switch on the Nikon Microscope control unit
3). Wait for 5 seconds
4). Switch on the microscope
5). Give some time to settle up the microscope(in this time microscope sets to initial default position).
 
Setting Ti2 pad
 L - represents that complete light pass to left camera
R -  L - represents that complete light pass to right camera
upside(eye symbol) - complete light pass to eyepiece
downside(L+eye symbol) - 50% light paas to left camera and 50% pass to eyepiece

1). By default Ti2 pad sets to passing light 100% to left camera
2). But we are working with the camera which is in left side to our microscope to capture images, so we put  downside(L+eye symbol) on.
3). This we can do manually by pressing it or by using NIS elements software we do as follows
View -> acquisition control ->Ti2 pad

Stage setting:

Initially microscope sets to default position
If we want to change the position of stage we follow as
View -> acquisition control -> XYZ navigation
From this we can change XY position and height(Z) position also
For huge change in movement put coarse and for little change put it in fine mode
This we can do also by using XYZ overview as
 View -> acquisition control -> XYZ overview
Then double click on the rectangle box at which corner you wanted to locate it.
Image capturing using NIS elements software:
Before opening the NIS elements software make sure the following 
1). Digital camera is connected to your microscope and the supported drivers have installed in your computer.
2). Power supply to digital camera and USB cable from CPU to digital camera.
3).swith on the light source button on microscope
4). Make sure that the 50% light coming from microscope i.e downside button(L+eyepiece) is on
5). Choose any objective(10x, 20x, 40x_flourescence, 40x_LWD, 60x_flourescence) through which you want to capture image.
Now Open the NIS elements software (Icon present on desktop) and chose camera as HIMAMATSU. Then change the stage location(if needed) according to the sample alignment.
Acquire -> Live fast (or live quality mode) 
Then our sample image will be displayed on screen, if it is not visible properly then we have to change contrast and Z(height of objective) location till we get sharp images.
file-> save as-> give name accordingly and save
(or)
If we press capture and store button then it will get stored in NIS elements-> images path with thaking name as seqxxxx.jpg, where xxxx is the sequence number(in increase in number).
